# Step 1: Create a file and name it
# Step 2: Print name
print("Farhan Chowdury ")
# Step 3: Create var "fav show" storing name of fav show
favorite_show = "South Park"
# Step 4: Use snake case to create ONE float and integer
pounds = 90.5
deaths = 127
# Step 5: Print the product of variables
print(pounds * deaths)
# Step 6: Create var that stores >=3 fav foods
foods = ["byrani, pizza, cheesecake"]
# Step 7: Create if statement to determine drivers' license eligibility
age = int(input("Enter your age. "))
if age >= 16:
    print("You can get a driver's license! Hooray! ")
else:
    print("You are NOT eligible for a driver's license. Womp womp. ")
# Step 8: Ask for name, print to console
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(name)
# Step 9: Create a for loop printing each of fav food
for x in foods:
    print(x)
    if x == "pizza":
        print("Mamma mia ")
# Step 10: Create a while loop that never runs
